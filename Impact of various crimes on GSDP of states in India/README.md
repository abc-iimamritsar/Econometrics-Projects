Our Objective is to statistically examine the impact of various crimes on the GSDP(Gross state Domestic Product) growth rate taking into account various crimes between 2001-11.  We have collected the crimes recorded in individual states from 2001 to 2011 from Ministry of Home Affairs reports on Crime in India, official database of Indian Government (www.data.gov.in ).  We have also collected the GDP Data for individual state over the period of time from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation website (http://www.mospi.gov.in). The data so formed is Panel Data. Scope for improvement - To enhance the model, variables that capture change in government, FDI, infrastructure spending can be added.
